# fomcon

This code is dependent on control 0.8.1 tool box for python. Control tool box has other dependencies like numpy, scipy and slycot.
if you are using a windows sytem you might face challenges installing slycot because there will be need to install a fotran compiler to build slycot from the repository.

recommended fotran compiler is Intel Math Kernel Library 2019.0.117, it works perfectly with anaconda 2019.3

Python environment used for this development is conda, but ide is pycharm
